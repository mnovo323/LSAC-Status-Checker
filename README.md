# LSAC Status Checker

Automatically check your law school application statuses without logging into multiple portals. Get notified when your status changes!

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Multi-School Support** - Check all your applications at once
- üö® **Change Detection** - Get alerted when statuses update or checklist items complete
- üíæ **Smart Caching** - Authentication token saved for 24 hours (no repeated logins)
- üìä **Comprehensive Info** - View status, checklists, letters of recommendation, fees, and scholarships
- üîí **Secure** - Credentials stored locally in `.env` file

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- LSAC account with applications submitted

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lsac-status-checker.git
   cd lsac-status-checker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Create `.env` file**
   
   **Linux/Mac:**
   ```bash
   echo "LSAC_USERNAME=your_username" > .env
   echo "LSAC_PASSWORD=your_password" >> .env
   ```
   
   **Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```powershell
   @"
   LSAC_USERNAME=your_username
   LSAC_PASSWORD=your_password
   "@ | Out-File -FilePath .env -Encoding utf8
   ```
   
   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```cmd
   echo LSAC_USERNAME=your_username > .env
   echo LSAC_PASSWORD=your_password >> .env
   ```
   
   **Or just create the file manually:**
   - Create a new file named `.env` (note the leading dot)
   - Add these two lines:
     ```
     LSAC_USERNAME=your_username
     LSAC_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```

4. **Create `schools.txt` file**
   
   Add your school status checker links. Get these from:
   - Emails from law schools with "Check Application Status" links
   - Law school admissions portals
   - LSAC status checker emails
   
   **Format options:**
   
   ```txt
   # Option 1: Just paste the link
   https://aso.lsac-unite.org/?guid=xjQd2C0H4WM%3d
   
   # Option 2: School name on line above link
   Cooley Law School
   https://aso.lsac-unite.org/?guid=abc123
   
   # Option 3: School name | link (same line)
   Yale Law School | https://aso.lsac-unite.org/?guid=def456
   
   # Mix and match any format!
   ```

## Usage

Run the checker:

```bash
python lsac_checker.py
```

**First run:**
- Browser window will open
- Logs you in automatically
- Shows all application statuses
- Saves status to `status_history.json`

**Subsequent runs:**
- Uses saved authentication token (no browser needed for 24 hours)
- Compares with previous status
- Shows üö® alerts for any changes

## Example Output

```
‚úÖ Loaded 5 school(s) from schools.txt

üìö Checking status for 5 school(s)...

‚úÖ Loaded saved authentication token

## Automation

Set up a daily check using cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows):

### Linux/Mac (cron)

```bash
# Run daily at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/lsac-status-checker && /usr/bin/python3 lsac_checker.py >> lsac.log 2>&1
```

### Windows (Task Scheduler)

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Trigger: Daily at 9:00 AM
4. Action: Start a program
   - Program: `python`
   - Arguments: `C:\path\to\lsac_checker.py`
   - Start in: `C:\path\to\lsac-status-checker`

## Files Created

- `token.json` - Cached authentication token (expires after 24 hours)
- `status_history.json` - Previous status for change detection
- `lsac.log` - Optional log file if you redirect output

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to capture token"
- Token capture failed during login. Try running again.
- Check if your credentials in `.env` are correct
- Make sure Chromium is installed: `playwright install chromium`

### "Invalid GUID"
- One of your status checker links is incorrect
- Make sure you copied the full URL including `?guid=...`
- Check for duplicate GUIDs in `schools.txt`

### "400 Bad Request"
- The GUID might be URL-encoded incorrectly
- Try copying the link directly from your email/portal again

### Browser doesn't close
- The script is still running - wait for it to complete
- If stuck, press Ctrl+C to cancel

## Privacy & Security

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit your `.env` file** - it contains your credentials
- All data stays local on your machine
- No data is sent anywhere except to LSAC's official servers
- Open source - review the code yourself!
